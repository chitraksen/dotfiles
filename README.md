# usage
run from cloned dir
```bash
chmod +x update_dotfiles.sh
./update_dotfiles.sh
```

# idea
- watch youtube video about gnu stow to manage dotfiles
- too complicated, this should be easier
- just write small shell script to copy over all files to repo and sync if changes found
- sure it's not as efficient as creating the symlinks, but all my dotfiles <1mb so do i really care?

# todo
- write shell script to put files back in relevant locations
  - don't care, not doing till i have the need to setup new machine
